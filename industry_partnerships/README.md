# UNCC Computer Vision Industry and Community Partnerships

![](graphics/industry_partner_lander.gif)

## Why?
Cheap and ubiquitous cameras coupled with powerful algorithms are enabling an enormous number of new computer vision applications. In Computer Vision (ITCS 4152/5152) at UNCC, students learn to build these computer vision algorithms. Where things get really exciting is when students can use these algorithms to **solve real problems.** 

## What?
The partnership program connects groups of students in ITCS 4152/5152 (typically groups of 4, 3 grad students, 1 undergrad) with local partners. Partners provide a problem of interest, and meet with teams 3 times over the course of the semester to provide guidance and direction. 

## Expectations

### Benefits to Partners
- Terrific way to identify well-qualified interns or hires
- Learn how cutting-edge deep learning techniques apply to your specific problem

### Benefits to Students
- Get work on a real problem
- A little guidance along the way
- Exposure to interesting places to potentially work
- Strong incentive to actually get stuff done

### Disclaimers
- In the unlikely case than patentable intellectual property is developed in the course of the project, patent ownership defaults to UNCC. Specific intellectual property agreements may be formed between the UNCC Office of Technology and industry partners if needed, please inquire for more information. 
- Students retain ownership of the copyright of their work as defined in [University Policy 315](https://legal.uncc.edu/policies/up-315#V.D). 

## Fall 2019 Schedule

### Meeting 1: Topic Selection (September)
- Partners will choose 1-3 interesting problems for teams to potentially work on.
- Meeting location + times will be coordinated between teams and partners
- Partners may provide data to treams
- Topic should be nailed down by the end of September

### Meeting 2: Midway Update (October)
- Teams will present a review of relevant academic literature, publically available data, tools, and code; and existing industry solutions. Findings will be shared in a short slide deck and short write up.

### Meeting 3: Final Presentation (December)
- Partners are invited to attend final group presentations at UNCC. If the timing doesn't work, teams will present twice - once at UNCC final groups presentations, and meet with partners independently for final presentations.
- Teams will share a demo of the solution they have developed, and share key findings form the development process.
