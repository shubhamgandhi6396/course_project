# Course Project

There are a large and rapidly growing number of remarkable applications of Computer Vision. From autonomous cars to smart manufacturing to augmented reality, inexpensive and ubiquitous cameras have made computer vision tools and techniques more relevant than ever. Cheap cameras and smart algorithms are empowering engineers to find creative solutions to important problems, provide real value to customers, and create products that simply could not have existed before.

# A Few Interesting Computer Vision Applications

# Mapillary

# About the Course Project 

As part of this course, students work to build a solution to a **real computer vision problem** as part of a semester-long group project. The technology developed by the companies shown above is intended to show the broad range of possible computer vision applications, and give a little taste for what's happening in the industry right now. Of course, these companies have built some truly remarkable technology that will take longer than a single semester to implement. However, all these companies did start somewhere, likeley with a **Minimum Viable Product (MVP)**. 

This is the project. Find a real problem, and create an MVP that provides real value for someone. 


Projects will be broken into and evaluated in 4 stages:

|         |   Stage     | Description                 | Deliverable           | Due Date      | Percent of Course Grade    | 
| ------- | --------------- | --------------------------- | --------------------- | -------------- | ---------   |
|    1    | Topic Selection | What CV problem will you go after?  | 1 page writeup | 9/17   |  1%  | 
|    2    | Research + Data Collection | Who are your customers? (Talk to them for extra credit)| Writeup summarizing  research, and visualizing dataset | 10/10 | 10% |
|    3    | Modeling | Build and train your models. Experiment. | Well-documented, visually pleasing, and clear jupyter notebook presenting results. | 11/5| 15% |
|    4    | Presentation + Storytelling | Craft your story. Create videos + visuals. Document your project. | Public Github repo with well-documented implementation of your solution, final presentation, and deliverables from previous stages | 12/3| 14% | 


## Meetings 
Throughout the course of the semester, your team will meet individually with TAs and Instructor to review your progress three times over the course of the semester, after the completion of stages 1, 2, and 3. You must schedule your meetings via calendly, a link will be provied. You will only receive credit for each stage after your individual meetings. 

## 1. Topic Selection
There are a huge number of interesting applications of computer vision. Good course project topics will meet a few criteria: 

1. Use image or video data as primary data source
2. Leverage Computer Vision algorithms on top of data
3. Provide value to someone, solve a real problem. 


### Deliverables
A printed one page proposal submission + resume(s) of individual team members on Canvas. If you already have team members in mind, you may submit a single proposal as a group. Submissions should inlcude your name(s), grad/undergrad status, phone number and email, a writeup of your topic proposal, a proposed final technology demo, and your resume(s). If you would like to collaborate with an industry partner (listed on Canvas), include the partner you would like to collaborate with, and tailor your proposal to your partner. Keep in mind that your partner may wish to change your topic. Given more demand than industry partners, groups will be selected for partnerships based on the quality of proposal. 

### Final Team Creation
We will make final team assignments. Ideally, each group will be composed of 2-3 graduate students and 1 undergraduate student. We will do our best to put you with requested team members, and assign you to the topic of our interest. 


## 2. Research + Data Collection

### 2.1 Research

Your research should be spread accross a few key areas. Depending on your project, your research may be more "business focused" or more "academically" focused. You should address at least 10 of the questions below, and must choose and review 3 academic papers. 

#### 2.1.1 Business/Customers
- What problem will your Computer Vision solution solve, and for whom? 
- What value will it provide them? What are their pain points? 
- How big is the potential market? 
- Do other similar solutions exist? 
- Would your business have any competitors? Who are they? How are they doing? 
- How are potential customers dealing with these issues now? 
- How much would customer be willing to pay for your product? 
- Are your customers individuals or businesses? Be sure to cite the sources you reference in your research. 

#### 2.1.2 Academic Literature Review
A thorough literature review can save weeks of wasted time implementing dead-end solutions or re-doing work that others have already done. You should pick 3 academic papers (we can help you with this, just ask), and do a "deep-dive" on these publications. 

- What academic work is relevant to your project topic? Pick 3 papers, ask us for help if you need it.
- What makes these papers important/relevant? 
- What are their results and how did they achieve these results?
- What's different/unique about these approaches?

#### 2.1.3 Open Source 
- What open source code is available that are relevant to your topic? 
- How active are the communities around this code? 
- What data is available for testing and/or training algorithms? 
- Is labeled data available? How much? How is the data licensed? Is it under copyright protection?

### 2.1.4 Industry Solutions
- What companies are solving similar problems to yours? 
- It can be tough to tell exactly how proprietary solutions work, but what can you find on the internet? 
- Has anyone reverse engineered these products?
- If you have access to the product, what can you learn from using it? 
- Are there available talks, documentation, or other resources from their engineering teams?

### 2.2 Data Collection
Your project will involve either collecting your own data or using publically available data. Getting your dataset nailed down early is critical to success. For most problems, you will need some type of labels to go with your images or videos. If you're creating your own dataset, you'll likely need to do your own labeling. There are great open source tools to help you with this like [labelme](https://github.com/wkentaro/labelme). 


### Deliverables:
Printed writeup addressing research questions above, and a jupyter notebook visualizing and summarizing your dataset. 

## 3. Modeling
This is the fun part! Build your models, conduct experiments, look at the literature you reviewed for ideas. 

### Deliverables
Well-documented, visually pleasing, and clear jupyter notebook presenting results.



## 4. Final Pitch + Demo


### Deliverables
10 minute presentation + demo of your technology to your peers. Briefly tell the story of the problem you set out to solve, what you learned about the problem in each of the previous stages, and demo the solution that you have developed. In addition to the presentation, final deliverables include a public Github repo containing a well-documented, visually pleasing, and clear implementation of your solution, final presentation, and deliverables from previous stages.


## Guidelines for Groups with Industry and Community Partners
Some groups will work with industry and community partners on projects. Clearly and consistently communicating with your partners is key to a successful project. After your initial kick-off meeting with your partners, you are expected to send short update emails to your partners every 2-3 weeks for the duration of your project. These will help keep your work aligned with your partners, and help break up the project into "sprints". Update emails should include: 

1. What you have accomplished since the last update. Specific details about learnings/ideas/approaches/things that are or are not working. Share images/vidoes or other intermediate results if you have them. 
2. What you are planning to accomplish before the next update. 
3. Any questions you have for your partners, and in the event that you need to meet/call with your partner in the next 2 weeks, a few proposed meeting times. 

Please copy your TAs + instructur on industry partner update emails. Partners are expected to meet with groups three times per semetester, including final presentation, but may meet more frequently if time permits.
